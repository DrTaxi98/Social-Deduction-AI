# Social-Deduction-AI
University Unity project that implements a simple AI for a social deduction video game.

## Description
The aim of this project is to design and implement an AI agent in Unity that simulates the behaviour of a human player in a typical social deduction game.

In this case, more agents have to roam around the map gathering information, while one of them is a killer.
If one of the agents find a dead body, a meeting starts, during which each agent share its relevant information, in order to identify a plausible suspect and vote it out.

## Report
For further information, see the project report: [Social_Deduction_AI.pdf](https://github.com/DrTaxi98/Social-Deduction-AI/blob/main/Social_Deduction_AI.pdf).

## Builds
You can find the project builds in the [Releases](https://github.com/DrTaxi98/Social-Deduction-AI/releases) section or on the itch.io page.

## Usage
The project can be played either from the Unity Editor or from a build:
- In the Unity Editor, you can set various parameters and see debugging information.
- In a build, you can only provide some inputs.

More detailed information are described in the [project report](https://github.com/DrTaxi98/Social-Deduction-AI/blob/main/Social_Deduction_AI.pdf) (see Chapter 4: Usage).
